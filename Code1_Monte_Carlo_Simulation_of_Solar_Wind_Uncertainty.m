%% Introduction
% The cross polar cap potential saturates at strong solar wind forcing. In particular, 
% the combined polar cap index (PCI = 0.5*(PCN+PCS)) - which is proportional to 
% the cross-polar cap electric field, which also appears to be linearly related 
% to the polar cap potential, saturates at high values of the solar wind "merging" 
% electric field ($E_m$). There are at least 10 models that attempts to explain 
% this non-linear relationship. All of these models propose a physical mechanism 
% that reduces the day-side reconnection rate or the potential in the ionosphere, 
% for a given solar wind driving (<http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/2009JA014058 Borovsky 
% 2009, Table A1>). However, we propose an alternate explanation: the uncertainty 
% in solar wind measurements. In other words, the merging electric field is an 
% uncertain estimate of the true driver - which is flow within the magnetosheath 
% on open magnetic field-lines from the polar cap.
% 
% Through this code, we demonstrate that the saturation of the polar cap potential 
% is a result of *our uncertainty* in 
%% 
% # the propagation delay of solar wind from L1 to the bow shock, 
% # the propagation of the day-side electric field from the magnetopause to 
% the polar cap ionosphere
% # the random variation in the magnitude of the solar wind electric field as 
% it propagates from L1 into the magnetosheath, and transmitted down to the polar 
% cap (magnitude uncertainty)
%% 
% The propagation delay of the effect of the solar wind forcing from L1, all 
% the way to the polar cap ionosphere, is stochastic. And as a result, there is 
% a small but random error in our best estimates of the propagation delay. Additionally, 
% there is a random (zero-mean) variability in the magnitude of the solar wind 
% geoeffective field as it propagates to the ionosphere due to physical processes 
% in the magnetosheath, which result in additional uncertainty in our best estimates 
% of the geoeffective field mapped to the polar cap. The uncertainty in our estimate 
% of the geoeffective field time-shifted to the polar cap, varies with the magnitude 
% of the field. Combining this property with the fact that the underlying probability 
% distribution of the geoeffective field is a log-normal distribution, results 
% in a biased estimate of the true solar wind driver which actually drives the 
% polar cap electric field.
% 
% In the following code, we develop a stochastic model (a monte-carlo simulation) 
% of the relationship between our estimate of the solar wind merging electric 
% field (${E^* }_m$ $\sim$ $X^*$) and its hypothetical true value ($X$). There 
% is reason to believe that mapping the geoeffective field accurately to the polar 
% cap leads to the combined polar cap index ($i\ldotp e\ldotp ,\;X\proptoY_{\textrm{PC}} 
% =\;\textrm{PCI}$) (Stauning 2012), as electric field along the open field-lines 
% from the polar cap, ought to be transmitted without attenuation along the field 
% line, as MHD theory holds true since there is no resistance parallel to the 
% field line. We use this assumption only to infer that the underlying probability 
% distribution and autocorrelation function of $X$ is similar to $\textrm{PCI}$. 
% Through our error model, we show that our estimate of the solar wind merging 
% electric field in the polar cap $X^*$*, is a biased estimate of* $X$, by making 
% informed estimate of the stochastic nature of $X$ and our uncertainty in the 
% propagation delay and intrinsic scatter. 
% 
% The most important result is that our bias, varies non-linearly with $X$. 
% The reason for this non-linear bias in the estimate is primarily due to the 
% misidentification of far more lower values of $X$ as high values.  And we find 
% that $X$ saturates with our estimate $X^*$, in the same way as the polar cap 
% index $\left(\textrm{PCI}\right)$ saturates with our estimate of the true shocked 
% solar wind driver ${E^{\textrm{sh}} }_m$. Firstly, this shows that an estimate 
% of the true solar wind driver will lead it to be exactly linear with $\textrm{PCI}$ 
% (with a ${45}^{\circ \;}$slope), and this is consistent with the model. And 
% if the stochastic model's relationship between $X$ and $X^*$ is true, and the 
% uncertainties in propagation delay and the magnitude uncertainty are true, then 
% the non-linearity between polar cap index (and hence the polar cap potential) 
% and solar wind forcing will follow logically from it.
% 
% In other words, given our uncertainty in the solar wind driver estimated at 
% L1, we should expect the exact statistical non-linear relationship we observe 
% between the polar cap potential and solar wind merging electric field. Finally, 
% we show that the same model predicts almost exactly the non-linear behavior 
% between auroral electrojet current strength (SML) and the merging electric field.

% *Defining data we use*
% 
% For solar wind geoeffective field values, we calculate that using the time-shifted 
% WIND measurements from the OMNI2 database. 
% 
% For the polar cap potential, we use the polar cap index data set.  
% 
% Xm - The solar wind geoeffective field, derived from OMNI measurements. $X_m 
% =E_{m\;} =\textrm{VB}\;\sin^2 \;\frac{\theta }{2}\;$, in [mV/m]
% 
% PCC - Is the combined polar cap potential, in [mV/m]. It is a measure of the

% 
% acf_fit_PCC - The autocorrelation function associated with the measurement 
% PCI
% 
% acf_fit_var - The autocorrelation function associated with $\textrm{var}=X_m 
% -\textrm{PCI}\;$
%% Error Model
% We develop a stochastic model, 
% 
% $$X^*(t) = X(t+dt_1 + dt_2) + \epsilon(t)$$
% 
% where statistical properties of $X$ corresponds to $\textrm{PCI}$, and $X^*$ 
% corresponds to ${E^* }_m \left(t+<{\textrm{dt}}_1 >+<{\textrm{dt}}_2 >\right)$ 
% that is time shifted with a constant propagation delay from L1, to nose, to 
% the ionosphere. 
% 
% How we arrived at this relationship between $X^*$ and $X$, is described in 
% the detailed diagram below. Here, $t$ is the time of the measurement at L1. 
% 
% 
% 
% Inspired from data, we assume input distribution and ACFs for $X$. 
% 
% $$\begin{array}{l}X\sim \textrm{Lognormal}\left(\mu \;=-0\ldotp 2518,\sigma 
% =0\ldotp 85\right)\\R_{\textrm{XX}} \left(\tau \;\right)\sim \textrm{from}\;\textrm{data}\end{array}$$
% 
% 
% 
% We estimate the magnitude uncertainty in $X$ from a database of THEMIS, MMS, 
% Cluster satellites within the magnetosheath that are close to the bowshock, 
% and estimate for a given value of $E_m^{sh}$ measured at the magnetosheath the 
% variance in the corresponding $E_m^*$ measured at L1. This appears to increase 
% with true solar wind driver $E_m^{sh}$ uptil 12 mV/m, and then remain the same 
% or increase, there is not enough data to say eitherway. The relative error is 
% shown here. 
% 
% $$\begin{array}{l}\epsilon \left(t\right)=f\left(X\left(t\right)\right)N\left(t\right)\\N\sim 
% \textrm{Normal}\left(\mu =0,\sigma =1\right)\end{array}$$
% 
% Shape of $f\left(x\right)$ is determined by the uncertainty estimated from 
% the python code that analyzes data from the magnetosheath measurements, and 
% the function is given by bayanefit. 
% 
% We also assume an autocorrelation for the $\epsilon \left(t\right)$, inspired 
% from the $\textrm{ACF}$ observed in the difference ${E^* }_m -\textrm{PCI}$
% 
% $\epsilon \;\left(t\right)$ corresponds to variability caused by *scattering 
% within the magnetosheath* of shocked plasma upstream of and as it flows perpendicular 
% to open field lines from the polar ionosphere. Sources of this scattering might 
% be - the slowing or speeding up of the solar wind as it travels from L1 to nose, 
% foreshock effects, plasma jets and waves in the magnetosheath and magnetopause. 
% It is a heteroscedastic variability, i.e., the variance increases with increasing 
% value of $X$. 
% 
% 
% 
% We also estimate the uncertainty in propagation delays from pervious literature.
% 
% $${\textrm{dt}}_1 ~\textrm{uncertainty}\;\textrm{in}\;\textrm{the}\;\textrm{delay}\;\textrm{from}\;\textrm{L1}\;\textrm{to}\;\textrm{magnetopause}\;\textrm{nose}\;\left(\textrm{bowshock}\right)$$
% 
% $${\textrm{dt}}_2 ~\textrm{uncertainty}\;\textrm{in}\;\textrm{the}\;\textrm{delay}\;\textrm{from}\;\textrm{magnetopause}\;\textrm{nose}\;\textrm{to}\;\textrm{polar}\;\textrm{cap}\;\textrm{ionosphere}$$

% $t_1$is our estaimte of the solar wind propagation from L1 to nose
%

%% Output
% Estimated polar cap potential
% The primary output of the model is $X^* \left(t\right)$ or "WI". This is our 
% erroneous estimate of the polar cap electric field. It is estiamted by erroneously 
% propagating the solar wind geoeffective field into the ionosphere, by assuming 
% a constant delay, and no other source of variability. From this output, we can 
% derive many other quantities of interest, that can ultimately explain the non-linearity 
% we observe between $E_{\textrm{PC}}$ and ${E^* }_m$.

% be because the variance of PCI for values of ${E^* }_m >10\;$mV/m is likely 
% underestimated because of the sparse data.

% Panel 2a and Panel 2b: Show the bias in the variability or error, and how

% for the normalized bias below 10 mV/m which is overestimated, probably because 
% of overestimating the probability of low error values shown previously. And 
% this bias is a result of the uncertainty in the propagation delay (${\textrm{dt}}_1

% Explaining the origin of the non-linear bias (Figure ED8)
% The non-linear increase in bias that you see in the above plots, is a result 
% of the tranformation of $X$ into $X^*$, despite the zero-mean random nature 
% of propagation delay uncertainity, and the intrinsic scatter. 
% 
% Panel (Left): In the plot below, the left panel shows the probability distribution 
% of $X$, colored in accordance with the value of $X$.
% 
% The stochstic model, transforms $X$ into $X^*$. 
% 
% Panel (Right): The right panel shows the probabiliy distribution of $X^*$, 
% the transformed variable, but with the color still in accordance with the value 
% of $X\;$- the input to the model. 
% 
% As you can see, a large proportional of small $X$ values, are now associated 
% with large values of $X^*$. Naturally, this brings down the value of $X$ given 
% a particular $X^*$ closer to the mean. This explains the bias. 
% 
% Why is the bias non-linear?
%% 
% # The fact that there are far more values of $X$ at lower mangitudes, than 
% higher magnitudes, due to the underlying probability distribution of $X$ being 
% log-normal. 
% # And the heteroscedastic nature of the scattering of $X$ (which implies a 
% multiplicative error model, see <https://www.google.com/books/edition/Measurement_Error_in_Nonlinear_Models/9kBx5CPZCqkC?hl=en 
% Carroll et al., 2006, Sec 4.5.2,> that can cause a regression attenuation (bias) 
% that is non-linear)
%% 
% The above two facts are the reasons behind the non-linearity in the observed 
% bias in the conditional expectation $<X|X^* >$ and also $<E_{\textrm{PC}} |{{\hat{\;E}

%% Result 2: Saturation of Auroral Currents Explained (as well)
% For the sake of argument, if we assume, the auroral currents increase linearly 
% with electric field in the ionosphere, such as $Y_{\textrm{SML}} =-120\;X+N\left(0,\sigma 
% \;\right)$, then the conditional expectation $<Y|X^* >$will non-linearly increase 
% with $X^*$. And this non-linearity, is exactly similar to what we observe from 
% data. 
% 
% In the plot below, the green-line, is the conditional expectation of the auroral 
% electrojet strength given time-shifter solar wind geoeffective field: $<\textrm{SML}|{E^* 
% }_m >$. This matches exactly with the model prediction $<Y|X^* >$, the magneta 
% line, provided we make the above assumption of a linear relationship between 
% $Y_{\textrm{SML}}$ (model proxy for $\textrm{SML}$) and $Y_{\textrm{PC}} =X$ 
% (model proxy for $E_{\textrm{PC}}$, effective ionospheric electric field). 
% 
% This result implies, that the non-linear relationship between auroral electrojet

%% Correcting for the bias: Regression calibration
% When we have the conditional expectation of the true value given an erroneous 
% estiamte such as $f_r \left(x\right)=\langle X|X^* =x\rangle$, such as what 
% we obtained in result 1 and result 2, these can be considered the best estimate 
% of the true values given the erroroneous estimate. $f_r \left(x\right)$can be 
% used to statistically correct ${E^* }_m$ to its most likely estimate of the 
% true value $E_m^c$. Hence, the input solar wind forcing variable (X-axis in 
% result 1 and 2) can be resplaced with the statistically corrected variable ${E^c 
% }_m$. This is simply ${E^c }_m =\langle X|X^* ={E^* }_m \rangle \;$. We carry 
% this out by interpolating the best estimates of the model true values given 
% model erroneous values $\langle X|X^* =x\rangle$ when $x={E^* }_m \;$.

% KDE2D
% fast and accurate state-of-the-art bivariate kernel density estimator with 
% diagonal bandwidth matrix.

function [bandwidth,density,X,Y]=kde2d(data,n,MIN_XY,MAX_XY)
% fast and accurate state-of-the-art
% bivariate kernel density estimator
% with diagonal bandwidth matrix.
% The kernel is assumed to be Gaussian.
% The two bandwidth parameters are
% chosen optimally without ever
% using/assuming a parametric model for the data or any "rules of thumb".
% Unlike many other procedures, this one
% is immune to accuracy failures in the estimation of
% multimodal densities with widely separated modes (see examples).
% INPUTS: data - an N by 2 array with continuous data
%            n - size of the n by n grid over which the density is computed
%                n has to be a power of 2, otherwise n=2^ceil(log2(n));
%                the default value is 2^8;
% MIN_XY,MAX_XY- limits of the bounding box over which the density is computed;
%                the format is:
%                MIN_XY=[lower_Xlim,lower_Ylim]
%                MAX_XY=[upper_Xlim,upper_Ylim].
%                The dafault limits are computed as:
%                MAX=max(data,[],1); MIN=min(data,[],1); Range=MAX-MIN;
%                MAX_XY=MAX+Range/4; MIN_XY=MIN-Range/4;
% OUTPUT: bandwidth - a row vector with the two optimal
%                     bandwidths for a bivaroate Gaussian kernel;
%                     the format is:
%                     bandwidth=[bandwidth_X, bandwidth_Y];
%          density  - an n by n matrix containing the density values over the n by n grid;
%                     density is not computed unless the function is asked for such an output;
%              X,Y  - the meshgrid over which the variable "density" has been computed;
%                     the intended usage is as follows:
%                     surf(X,Y,density)
% Example (simple Gaussian mixture)
% clear all
%   % generate a Gaussian mixture with distant modes
%   data=[randn(500,2);
%       randn(500,1)+3.5, randn(500,1);];
%   % call the routine
%     [bandwidth,density,X,Y]=kde2d(data);
%   % plot the data and the density estimate
%     contour3(X,Y,density,50), hold on
%     plot(data(:,1),data(:,2),'r.','MarkerSize',5)
%
% Example (Gaussian mixture with distant modes):
%
% clear all
%  % generate a Gaussian mixture with distant modes
%  data=[randn(100,1), randn(100,1)/4;
%      randn(100,1)+18, randn(100,1);
%      randn(100,1)+15, randn(100,1)/2-18;];
%  % call the routine
%    [bandwidth,density,X,Y]=kde2d(data);
%  % plot the data and the density estimate
%  surf(X,Y,density,'LineStyle','none'), view([0,60])
%  colormap hot, hold on, alpha(.8)
%  set(gca, 'color', 'blue');
%  plot(data(:,1),data(:,2),'w.','MarkerSize',5)
%
% Example (Sinusoidal density):
%
% clear all
%   X=rand(1000,1); Y=sin(X*10*pi)+randn(size(X))/3; data=[X,Y];
%  % apply routine
%  [bandwidth,density,X,Y]=kde2d(data);

% Colormap

function map = colormap(arg1,arg2)
    %COLORMAP Color look-up table.
    %   COLORMAP(MAP) sets the current figure's colormap to MAP.
    %
    %   COLORMAP('default') sets the current figure's colormap to
    %   the root's default, whose setting is PARULA.
    %
    %   COLORMAP(TARGET,...) sets the colormap for the figure, axes, or chart
    %   specified by TARGET. After setting the axes colormap, the figure
    %   colormap does not affect the axes.
    %
    %   MAP = COLORMAP(...) returns the three-column matrix of RGB triplets
    %   defining the colormap of the target or the current figure.
    %
    %   A colormap matrix may have any number of rows, but it must have
    %   exactly 3 columns. Each row is interpreted as a color, with the
    %   first element specifying the intensity of red light, the second
    %   green, and the third blue. Color intensity can be specified on the
    %   interval 0.0 to 1.0.
    %   For example, [0 0 0] is black, [1 1 1] is white,
    %   [1 0 0] is pure red, [.5 .5 .5] is gray, and
    %   [127/255 1 212/255] is aquamarine.
    %
    %   Graphics objects that use pseudocolor -- SURFACE and PATCH objects,
    %   which are created by the functions MESH, SURF, and PCOLOR -- map
    %   a color matrix, C, whose values are in the range [Cmin, Cmax],
    %   to an array of indices, k, in the range [1, m].
    %   The values of Cmin and Cmax are either min(min(C)) and max(max(C)),
    %   or are specified by CLIM. The mapping is linear, with Cmin
    %   mapping to index 1 and Cmax mapping to index m. The indices are
    %   then used with the colormap to determine the color associated
    %   with each matrix element. See CLIM for details.
    %
    %   Type HELP GRAPH3D to see a number of useful colormaps.
    %
    %   COLORMAP is a function that sets the Colormap property of a figure.
